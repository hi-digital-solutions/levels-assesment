# DS Levels Assessment Instructions 

## Why are we doing this? 

This assessment is a tool to help facilitate discussions about pay and job title, personal improvement efforts, and responsibilities. 

The outcomes we want include: 

* Conversations about pay focus on specific indicators that drive positive results   
* We can recognize and correct bias due to race, gender, age, or other arbitrary factors   
* Transparency on how we make pay decisions   
* A clear path to promotion that can help guide personal improvement efforts   

## What are we NOT trying to do? 

This is not meant to be a completely objective, computational way of determining pay; there will always be a subjective component. 

This is not the only input for pay decisions.  Project-level outcomes, informal feedback from others, and similar factors will also be considered. 

## What does the process look like? 

You will always have feedback from multiple different people:  you’ll assess yourself, and you’ll also get an assessment from your manager, as well as members of your team.  

The result of these assessments will be a range of levels--”the assessment puts you between level 4 and level 7.”  This will generally lead to deeper conversations--perhaps the range is particularly wide (or narrow!), or we see very different results from different people.  The hope is that we can eventually get to a 1-1 discussion where we agree on a current level, together with an understanding of the feedback, and a clear path to the next level. 

## How do you assess others? 

The questions on the assessment are intended to map very closely to positive outcomes for the business--they are (hopefully!) indicators of success.   

We are looking for evidence, based on your own personal experience.  Second-hand observations are fine--”I’ve seen a lot of people reach out to this person in #tech-talk.”   At the same time, we want to avoid speculation; if you don’t have the context to answer, it’s fine to just leave the question blank.  

Most questions have a second axis:  Individual, Team, and Organization; often the same indicator can be applied to different contexts.  An example might be the concept of “improvement.”  You may have learned a new language (Individual), improved the way your team slices its stories (Team), and piloted a new way to get cost and value estimations that becomes a standard part of the Business Agility Framework (Organization), over the same six-month period.  

In a very real way, these types of work are additive; you generally can’t drive Org-level outcomes without also doing work at the Team level, and you can’t do either without continuing to build your own, Individual skills.  Team and Org-level skills become more important as you move into higher levels.   

A helpful template might be to fill in the blanks:  “I <Almost Always> see <Person> <Leave things better than they found them> at the <Individual,Team,Org> level.  Think about specific examples you’ve seen! 

If you’re having trouble deciding which choice makes sense, try writing down specific examples.  If you can’t think of any, that’s probably “Almost Never.”  If you can easily think of several off the top of your head, that might be “Almost Always!” 

## FAQs 

Q: What timeframe does this assessment cover?  
A: We’ll be doing this assessment yearly, so we’re looking for examples in the past year or so.  
  
Q: What constitutes the Organization?  
A: The Org will always include both HI Digital Solutions, and any other group we are working with (for example, Home Instead).   
  
Q: I’m doing a self assessment; how should I answer the question about “do I enjoy working with this person?”  
A: For self assessments, just leave this question blank.   
  
Q: I have low rankings on some Team or Org questions because of my role.  What should I do?  
A: This will be part of the conversation around personal development; we will work together to determine where you should be focusing, and to find opportunities for you to be involved at the appropriate level.     
  
Q: The person I’m assessing hasn’t had a chance to participate in hiring.  How should I rank them?  
A: You should rank them based on your experience.  If you know they’ve never interviewed, then it’s fine to say “<Person> <Almost Never> <Brings the right people into the organization> <at the Individual level>,” or to leave the question blank.
